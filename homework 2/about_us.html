    <p><i>NON TI PAGO</i> is a small family-run business, specialising in quality and authentic Italian food products.
    </p>
    <p>It was founded in 2002 by Anna and Stacey Clerk following in Anna’s father’s footsteps and passion for his
        home country and its culture. </p>
    <p>We give you the authenticity of traditional Italian food while adding a modern twist to our dishes – carefully
        crafted to give your palate a sure treat.</p>

    <p>Respect of tradition, love for good food and warm of the staff, will help you to enjoy the flavors and atmosphere
        of the typical <i>“NON TI PAGO”</i></p>
    <p>The Restaurant is divided into three rooms reachable through some wooden steps, characteristic of the premises of
        the old town of the early 20th: wood, marble and wrought iron are the essential elements of a place with a
        classic atmosphere and at the same time warm and welcoming.</p>


    <p>The signature pastas are made in-house daily and are paired with the highest quality, locally sourced
        ingredients.</p>
    <p> It is a celebrated neighborhood restaurant offering a reliably indulgent experience, whether for a
        special occasion or enjoying dinner with friends.</p>

    <p>Anna Clerk is a dreamer, mother of three children. A real self-made woman, here where the desires, seasoned with
        so much effort, can become reality.</p>
    <p>Anna has been a pizza chef since she was 13 years old, her craft took her around the world and finally to Las
        Vegas: first on vacation, immediately after work. </p>
    <p>After about three years in LA, she meets her husband Andrew, and her life takes off. </p>
    <p>In January 2002, thanks
        to her, and with the help of her sister Stacey, and their father Giovanni, the <i>NON TI PAGO</i> project
        started. </p>
